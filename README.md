# Retail-Sales-done-in-SQL-and-Power-BI

In this case study, we were tasked with conducting an end-to-end project (ETL) where we built an interactive dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) to address a client or stakeholder business inquiries and provide data-driven insights.

For my project, I employed the ETL method by extracting the 'retail shop sales' dataset from Kaggle. I performed data transformations in MySQL to create specific datasets that address the client's business questions. Subsequently, I loaded these datasets into Power BI to develop a dashboard. This visual tool was designed to explain the KPIs and provide insights to the client, helping them make informed business decisions.

SQL: CTEs, Joins, Case, Window functions and aggregate functions

Power BI: ETL, writing functions/measures, calculating columns, data visualization, data modeling
