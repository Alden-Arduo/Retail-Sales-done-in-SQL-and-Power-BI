# Retail-Sales-done-in-SQL-and-Power-BI

RETAIL SHOP SALES PROJECT
In this case study, we were tasked with conducting an end-to-end project (ETL) where we built an interactive dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) to address a client or stakeholder business inquiries and provide data-driven insights.  
For my project, I employed the ETL method by extracting the 'retail shop sales' dataset from Kaggle. I performed data transformations in MySQL to create specific datasets that address the client's business questions. Subsequently, I loaded these datasets into Power BI to develop a dashboard. This visual tool was designed to explain the KPIs and provide insights to the client, helping them make informed business decisions.

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
KPIâ€™s REQUIREMENTS BY CLIENT/STAKEHOLDER:
1.	TOTAL SALES ANALYSIS
-	Calculate the total sales for each respective month and the difference in total sales (as percentage) between current and previous month
2.	TOTAL ORDER ANALYSIS
-	Calculate the total order for each respective month and the difference in total orders (as percentage) between current and previous month
3.	TOTAL QUANTITY SOLD ANALYSIS
-	Calculate the total quantity sold for each respective month and the difference in total quantity sold (as percentage) between current and previous month
CHARTS REQUIREMENTS:
1.	CALENDAR HEAT MAP
-	A heat map that adjusts for the chosen month which is colour-coded that shows a darker shade for higher sales, lighter shade for lower sales 
2.	SALES ANALYSIS BY WEEKDAYS AND WEEKENDS
-	Separates sales data into weekdays and weekends to see patterns
3.	SALES ANALYSIS BY AGE PER MONTH WITH AVERAGE LINE
-	Calculates the average sales by age for the chosen month which is also colour-coded, light orange for sales above average, light blue for sales below average
4.	SALES BY GENDER
-	Visualises the sales for each gender for that chosen month and shows the difference in sales as percentage between current and previous month 
5.	SALES BY PRODUCT CATEGORY
-	Visualises the sales for each product category for that chosen month and shows the difference in sales as percentage between current and previous month 
6.	DAILY SALES ANALYSIS WITH AVERAGE LINE
-	Calculates the daily average sales for the chosen month which is also colour-coded, light orange for sales above average, light blue for sales below average
-	Note: the dashboard should be filtered by month
